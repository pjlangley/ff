# Contributing to Fullstack Fragments

Thanks for considering a contribution! üòç

This is a learning space (for me) and collaboration with anyone kind enough to part with some of their time in order to
offer insight, expertise and improvements will be appreciated.

## General

- Fork repo and open a PR with your changes
- CI tasks must pass:
  1. [`.github/workflows/main.yml`](./.github/workflows/main.yml)
  1. [`.github/workflows/docker.yml`](./.github/workflows/docker.yml)

## Sample specific changes

In addition to the General section above:

- Sample changes should continue their goal of single responsibility, with an emphasis on functional programming
- Any new samples should be provided in every supported programming language
- Keep the sample code as simple as possible; it really helps when comparing functionality between languages
- Solana programs to use the Anchor framework

## Multilingual

Translations in any language for the following would be amazing:

- [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) (this file)
- [`README.md`](./README.md)

For new translations, add a locale suffix to the file. For example, `README.es.md` for Spanish.

I'm not sure if there's anything else worth translating other than these ü§î
